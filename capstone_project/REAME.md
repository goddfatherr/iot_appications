# Capstone Project

This repository contains the files used to implement the capstone Project. 


## Scenario

## Objectives
Development of Temperature monitoring system with anomaly detection and prediction capabilities

## Implementation
Temperature monitoring system using the Bolt and LM35 sensor. This system sends mail when the temperature goes above predefined thresholds. 
Anomaly detection and Polynomimial Regression are used to detect anolmaly and predict temperatures that violate the set thesholds in advance.
