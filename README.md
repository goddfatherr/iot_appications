## Development Board
The applications are based on Bolt IoT wifi board manufactured by Inventrom Pvt. Ltd. The core features of the board include: 

The Bolt IoT WiFi boards are based on the ESP8266 WiFi module

The boards come with built-in WiFi connectivity and can connect to 802.11 b/g/n networks and support WPA/WPA2 encryption.

The boards support OTA (over-the-air) updates. This is the only way of programming the board.

## Platform
Bolt also provides a cloud-based development platform called Bolt Cloud, which allows users to write and deploy code for their Bolt devices from anywhere.

The Bolt IoT WiFi boards can be controlled using a smartphone app called Bolt IoT, which provides a user-friendly interface for controlling the sensors and actuators on the board and viewing data from the sensors.
